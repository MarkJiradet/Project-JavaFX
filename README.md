# Project-JavaFX

## 📚 About the Project

This repository contains several GUI-based Java applications developed using **JavaFX** as part of my coursework during my **first year** of university. Each project is built with a focus on practical desktop application development using **Java**, **JavaFX**, **MySQL**, and **Hibernate**.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Some projects may not include the database files due to file constraints or backup issues.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

Each subfolder represents a separate project:
```
Project-JavaFX/
├── CatHotel/
├── GGadget/
├── Shopdee/
├── Skinvy/
├── Smartphone_Shop/
└── Sociaga-Book-Shop/
```

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java** – Main programming language  
- **JavaFX** – For building graphical user interfaces (GUI)  
- **MySQL** – Relational database system (used in most projects)  
- **Hibernate** – ORM framework to manage database operations efficiently  

## 🎯 Objectives

- Practice building GUI desktop applications using JavaFX  
- Learn how to integrate Java applications with databases via Hibernate  
- Apply core concepts of OOP, database management, and user interaction in real-world-like scenarios  

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run any of these projects:

1. Open the project folder in your favorite IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).
2. Make sure JavaFX is properly configured in your development environment.
3. If a project uses a database:
   - Setup MySQL on your local machine
   - Import the relevant database if provided (some may be missing)
   - Update the database connection details in the code or `hibernate.cfg.xml` accordingly

Feel free to explore each folder and see how the UI and data integration are handled. These projects were an important step in my journey to becoming a developer.
