# Project-JavaFX

## 📚 About the Project

This repository contains several GUI-based Java applications developed using **JavaFX** as part of my coursework during my **first year** of university. Each project is built with a focus on practical desktop application development using **Java**, **JavaFX**, **MySQL**, and **Hibernate**.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Some projects may not include the database files due to file constraints or backup issues.
